# Coding an Equation 

Early on in my Python journey, I was assigned a project to tweak some code using the equation highlighted in yellow in the problem below. 

My mission? Fix up lines 2 and 3—making sure line 3 translates the equation into something Python won’t side-eye, while line 2 gets test data plugged in one at a time. 
Of course, I had to run each test to make sure the output actually made sense. The kicker? Only one test data number had to be submitted. 
Oh, and in case you forgot—Python plays by the rules when it comes to order of operations.

Now, here’s the wild part—I caught a mistake in the problem. 
Did you catch it too? One of those moments where you realize reading between the lines is just as important as writing them.
